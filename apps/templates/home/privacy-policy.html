            You may be entitled, where provided for under applicable law, to:
            •	Request access to the personal information we process about you: this right entitles you to know whether we hold personal information about you and, if we do, to obtain information on and a copy of the specific pieces and categories of personal information.
            •	Request a rectification of your personal information: this right entitles you to have your personal information corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete.
            •	Object to the processing of your personal information: this right entitles you to request that Southern Interests no longer processes your personal information.
            •	Request the erasure or deletion of your personal information: this right entitles you to request the erasure or deletion of your personal information, including where such personal information would no longer be necessary to achieve the purposes. 
            •	Request the restriction of the processing of your personal information: this right entitles you to request that Southern Interests only processes your personal information in limited circumstances, including with your consent. 
            •	Request portability of your personal information: this right entitles you to receive a copy (in a portable and, if technically feasible, readily usable format) of your personal information, or request Southern Interests to transmit such personal information to another data controller.
            California law provides California residents with the right to receive a privacy notice with information about what we have collected, disclosed for business purposes, and sold during the preceding 12 months. This Southern Interests Privacy Statement for California Residents provides information about the categories of information that we have collected, the sources of that information, the purposes for which we have used the information, and the categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed the information for business purposes.
            California law also affords California residents a right to opt out of the “sale” of your personal information. This right is applicable to the extent that Southern Interests is engaging in a “sale” of your personal information as that term is defined under applicable law. While Southern Interests generally is not in the business of selling information, there are limited circumstances where we share personal information with our clients, third-party partners, or others that we treat as a sale for which California residents have the right to opt out. We do not sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without affirmative authorization.
            If you choose to exercise your rights, we will not charge you different prices or provide different quality of services unless those differences are related to your personal information or otherwise permitted by law. Please click  to opt out of the “sale” of your personal information. If at any time you would like to opt back in and allow Southern Interests to sell your personal information, please click .
            To exercise any other rights available to you under California law, please contact us. Once we receive your request, we may verify it by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity. Where necessary, this may include asking you for a copy of your valid government-issued identification, such as your valid passport or driver’s license (with the allowance of the redaction of your driver’s license number or social security number). If you would like to use an authorized agent registered with the California Secretary of State to exercise your rights, we may request evidence that you have provided such agent with power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf that we can confirm directly with the requestor. We reserve the right to deny requests from authorized agents in certain circumstances, such as where we have a reasonable belief that the request is fraudulent. For this reporting period, Southern Interests does not qualify for the CCPA 11 CCR § 999.317(g) reporting requirement.
            Southern Interests may offer certain financial incentives for the collection, sale, or deletion of personal information. Where we would do so, we will provide California residents additional information where required by California law.
            To the extent that the processing of your personal information is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw such consent at any time by contacting . Please note that this will not affect Southern Interests’ right to process personal information obtained prior to the withdrawal of your consent, or its right to continue parts of the processing based on other legal bases than your consent.
            If, despite our commitment and efforts to protect your personal information, you believe that your data privacy rights have been violated, we encourage and welcome individuals to come to Southern Interests first to seek resolution of any complaint. You have the right at all times to register a complaint directly with the relevant supervisory authority or to make a claim against Southern Interests with a competent court (either in the country/State where you live, the country where you work or the country where you deem that data privacy law has been infringed).
            If you would like to exercise your erasure, rectification, or access rights in reference to your data as a job applicant, you may contact us to do so. Any other rights can be exercised by contacting us.
